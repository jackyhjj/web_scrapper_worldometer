# Web Scrapper Worldometer

Web Scrapper using Selenium Python on Worldometer Website (Covid-19)

This is a project that is initiated in the early year of 2020 when Covid-19 began spreading across the globe.

We make a group to collect data from different sources and present it in a website and I was delegated to do a web scrapper on worldometer for Coronavirus Data on every country with the related link on news sourcce.

It is a starter to begin collecting data and processing that data to become a graph and show how rapid is the spreading has become.

Basically this repo consists of 2 parts: The scrapper and the database.

As for the scrapper I am using python selenium scrapper and PostgreSQL for the database.
